## This is a NextJS prototype of a redesign of an e-commerce platform (BlitzSports, a martial arts supplier in the UK). It only has limited functionality. It was designed as an alternative to a figma prototype, to allow an interviewer to conduct a usability test with something that was closer to a customer facing product, and simulate functionality that is unavailable in figma.
